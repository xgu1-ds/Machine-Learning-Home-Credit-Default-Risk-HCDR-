# Home Credit Default Risk (HCDR)

The course project is based on the Home Credit Default Risk (HCDR) Kaggle Competition. The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan. In order to make sure that people who struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories have a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
